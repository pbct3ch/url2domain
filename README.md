Name:    Simple url2domain Converter Script
Repo:    https://github.com/pbct3ch/url2domain
Author:  Shane Daniels (PBCT3CH)
Notes:  url2domian.py will take in a file with URL strings and strip out the domain names.

This is a simple script that I wrote to remove domains from a text file that contained URLS.
